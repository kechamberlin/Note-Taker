# Note-Taker

Idea behind this application is for a user to write their own notes.

On the home page, the user's current notes are displayed on the bottom.  Meanwhile, if the user want to create a new note, he or she can click on the "new note" button.

Upon clicking the "new note" button, the user will be redirected to another HTML page.  Here, the user can fill out a title and body content for their note.

Upon clicking submit, the new note should be appending to the "current notes" card on the home page.
